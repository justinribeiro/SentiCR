Even loading the whole document and using XPath is marginally slower than SAX and nothing compared to getting the XML (network speed).
The answers to this question only work if you want to read the stream's contents _fully_ (until it is closed).

Also there are some issues that your facade would have to handle that commons logging already does.
Converting JSON to Java.
So inside of the Handler you get the username and password from user and it is passed to the LoginModule.
"part of them on AWT Components, part on Swing JCompoentns, but between AWT and Swing is difference with implemented, accesible and inherits methods, for example Swing JComponents directly (API) implements lots of inherit or nested methods directly from AWT :-)."
"At the end of the day, I have worked with different similar UI tools, Flash Builder, Delphi etc., but unless you do some relatively trivial UI design, not including much business logic and communication with other layers, you'll have to accept that what you are capable of creating in code once you learn to do it properly is much more powerful than what any editor is capable of providing you with."

much better.
"actually Swing uses a Model-Delegate approach, which is derived from the MVC approach, where in the View and Controller are combined for a Delegate structure."
If your string is not going to change use a String class because a CODETERM10 object is immutable.
The platform default is available from URL_http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/doc s/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html#defaultCharset%28%29 [the-CODETERM3-class] itself: CODESNIPPET_JAVA3 .

Why generate your own parser generator when you can use ANTLR?
Use CODETERM1 method on CODETERM2 .

"You can use URL_http://tomayac.de/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html [RestDescribe] to generate and compile WSDL, you can generate clients in php, ruby, python, java and C# using this."
All you do is annotate a POJO with JAXB annotations and include the proper libraries.
"Most servers have built-in SPNEGO support, so you shouldn't have to code something like an applet to do your authentication."
"If you need a native, pure Java solution, that leaves you with the rest."
An example of that dependency is the storing of string literals used for display (like label text).
