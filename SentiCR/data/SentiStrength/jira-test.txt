Thanks Sijie.
"Thanks, Dhruba!"

You would need to implement session resume; thats a whole new can of worms.

This is weird.

 Automatic location selection is very cool.
All I'm trying to say is that it's pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that are not foreseen.
I don't know what just happened.
"Thanks for the report, and sorry its taken so long to fix it."
I think the correct resolution is to ensure that the prefix stack mechanism gets reset each time the XMLReader is used.
yup sorry just fixed.
A stupid bug in a patch that is already applied.
i found the class - so there is no bug - sorry
> then we don't save IO by limiting the buffer size to 1 KBI'm confused by this.
Finally closing this bug from hell.
"Thanks Areek, patch looks good!"
Incidentally if we all nag Joe Walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc (though it will still struggle with generics I think)

An output connector should also have a say in what URLs it will accept.

Here is quite bad.
Sounds like a good idea.
"Sorry, I was trying to get to the wiki but it's been a busy week."

"Hi Guillaume,I did not have an answer right away, so I sent you question to Leonard Rosenthol."
Indeed that would be VERY bad design.
Maurice I don't have such option or maybe I don't know where it is.

Thanks for sweet patch Erik.
sorry.
Bad IE.

"<gmcdonald> , my bad"
Sorry for the noise.
"Thanks for spotting this, fixed at r487519"
I really like what I am seeing so far.
The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.

Sorry - the federated build is still working out kinks...

The rest are *totally* unrelated.
"[~cmccabe]: oh, hell no!"

"Thanks, Mike!"
Sorry.

Tried some more stuff and realized I was doing it wrong.
"Thanks for the very clear explanation of the needed change, Dag."
This patch really helped.

The biggest problem is that we've had too many committers over the years and we'd have to get all of their permission to change it.
thanks for the explanation.
Weird.
"The patch should be relatively trivial, but like I said, I have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not."
