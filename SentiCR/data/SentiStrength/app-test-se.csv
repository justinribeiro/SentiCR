just love it! been using for 9 months now and it is perfect app! ?,1
5 stars this is exactly what i am looking for. thank you so much.,1
great it's awesome,1
i hope there's penguinz this is a really fun game.,1
slow  no point. the viewfinder display is really laggy and slow.  doesn't seem to offer any creative black and white features so how does it improve over just desaturating color photos?,-1
"well.. it was awesome .. i do like the new look   but now it also now gets ""unexpected errors ""and hitting retry just gets the same.  won't work til you clear the data out in settings.. but doing that all the time is annoying. please fix this issue!",-1
awasome it is so cute,1
i like it because i enjoy it the picture is very small,1
? guns by calford is better,1
excellent app! but add more! this is much better than samsung's equation detection but the only thing missing in this app is the lack of variety. just like in the note 10.1  please add more equations and have the ability to solve complex algebra. i'll be glad to pay for such a feature. makes work so much easier!,1
it is fun i love it,1
yampee exellent nice and cool app,1

crashed system stopped working. no matter what i did this app kept crashing the system. my phone wouldn't work. the screen kept going black and i couldn't run anything. happened all of a sudden. uninstalled and went over to go launcher ex. same features  smoother  not crashing even with more widgets running. sorry adw.,-1
nice it is very useful,1
yala is an app for dowloading  and listening to arabic music and radio the idea and concept is amazing but it has so many bugs with lots of songs at times and it messes up my music when it connects to some random wifi. please stop and fix this.,-1
very easy and fun not many programs deserve a 5 star but this is one of them. i do miss some features (or maybe i just don't know how to use the app) like continue reading from my last page ad it sometimes reloads from start with me articles but overall this is a very good app. thanks guys!,1
great app.. nice app .. keep it up..  it is very useful app for us... *****,1
everything i wanted takes less space than default clock of moto x  and packs so much info. the default settings are pretty impressive. did not have to customize much. won't mind paying for it.,1
freezes is an awesome game until the past few days  it freezes after each mission.,-1
awesome to the developer i just gave another slot machine app very poor ratings your game is 100 the best on android and i've played all the slot machines android has to offer and by far plenty of coins and i'm having fun as hell if it drains all the money now i would not be disappointed i have never paid for a app but i think i will pay for this one stupendous job,1
very nice. great keyboard app. many great tools and a ton of customization.,1
game this game is kool!!!!,1
amazing! awesome app for mathematics. worth thousand starts. thanks devs. though the ui is hard to understand. thanks for the small size,1
invaluable! i use this app daily and can't imagine not having it.,1
won't load on s3 like everyone else game freezes when trying to load a mission. so they updated the app and now the new version isn't compatible with my phone.  bah puh!,-1
i really like this game!!!!!! this is a good game!!!!,1
woooow it is gooooooood game:-) :-) :-),1
freezes after about 2 minutes of gameplay,-1
anoying bug i use both the powertoggles notification bar widget and home screen widget.  really good concept as a whole. but... the home screen widget always freezes a couple hours after i configured it.  the widgetbis used to launch my favorite apps  not for toggling anything if you want to resolve it  i can try to give you more info. ofc rating goes up if this is resolved!! :-) ** bug doesn't occur anymore! :d,-1
match cast lines up don't show i mean aside from that the app is pretty great,1
? cute but eats up alot of battery.,-1
best twitter client! if you are looking for the best twitter client  search no more. this is it! it's similar to tweetbot on ios. you get all the great features from pull to refresh  inline images  column views  white/black holo theme background  tap to jump to top  and so much more. oh and there are no ads in this version. it is simply amazing.,1
help love this game but now it wont let me sell my fish. it freezes and crashes. please fix!,-1
? so far so good. ? however  freezes up way too much. hope that error gets fixed soon or i will have to give it the boot.,-1

excellent good app for people abroad,1
fun widget good selection of hilts and colors.,1
shame its a good game dont get me wrong but since theupdate with the hunter and new maps it freezes   unless you stik to old maps.... cumon update fix please,-1
awesome this app is legendary!,1
one thing missing i really like this app. simple user interface and works smoothly. espn should add a feature to notify you when your current selection is finished. that is the only thing missing.,1
excellent you can change your car s  it's easy to park it self,1
pls fix bugs nice apps!,-1
worked good at first... when i first got it  it worked well  now it freezes up and only displays blank white screen.,-1
simply the best i very rarely write reviews. even more rare is when i like an app enough to buy it. this app deserves both. i have  seriously  tried most music players for the android and this one has everything i need. audio engine is tops  start and stop via headphone jack  great album art download. lots of other programs have these things but either lack in these or other features. i especially like the simple issue of bass and treble control. price a little high  that was the only thing holding me back from buying it sooner. was thinking of giving it 4 stars because of price but; what the heck- i gave it five.,1
good app its a very good app  very nice and easy an simple ui.,1
good app i found the app is very good for forecast. i like it.,1
the game constantly freezes. very frustrated since update. the game freezes and goes to green screen. i have to restart tablet every time to get game to respond. fix?,-1
? motorola devour. becoming more and more sure this game freezes my phones? very fun game though? it is a challenge  and addictive?,0
slot game. it was a great game but it has stopped paying out almost completely.,-1
freezes every time only works when you restart your phone,-1
ads great app but the ads come up all the time and it ruins it,-1
very fun!! worth the memory.   :-d,1
horrible installed perfectly and though was great app. uploaded some pics from gallery with no problem. when wanted to take a pic as demo here shows above  it was just a black scree. pressed camera button  nothing. can upload from gallery  but cant use the main feature of this app which is what is advertised. why would i use this to upload from my phone? my phone hasd bluetooth  and a usb to hook up to my pc. i can send those pics via text  email  and facebook. the main purpose of this app does not work!,-1
great apps works well and looks great. lots of available providers. from the 5 or so apps i've tested  deliveries seems to support the most.  i submitted a bug report when statuses from one of the providers wasn't working as expected. the developer promptly got back to me and fixed the issue.   only feature i would like is auto-detection of provider based on the tracking number. but as a fellow programmer i understand the challenges presented by such a feature  so this doesn't affect my rating.,1
need to add a feature you guys should add a custom car builder feature where you can just build your own car but every part you buy will just keep adding up your total overall great app its fun and it kills time,1
great alarm  but has new bug making it use lots of battery i like this alarm  i definitely like being able to wake up to a random playlist. but since an update its now using massive amounts of battery using the gps. i'm guessing it's something to do with sunrise feature. i don't use the sunrise alarm and i certainly don't move between countries enough for it to constantly be updating. so either a setting to not allow access to gps or to only update once a day would be useful. otherwise i'll have to go back to the standard alarm until it's fixed.,0
gs3 best weather and clock widget out there hands down,1
good for me 112089 come to my friend in the game.,1
doesn't work fix bugs and maybe i'll give it 4 stars. sorry!,-1

freezes when browser loads freezes when browser loads to play game,-1
awesome it's very useful to all people.,1
can't install i can't install it on my samsung note iii please fix it. error. (941),-1
note 2 it's very useful to use........love it,1
good app it's customizable which i like. sometimes it's a bit difficult getting items to line up properly and the areas for each part of the display don't change size dynamically so the font sizes will get bigger or smaller to fit in the space alloted for them which i don't like. overall it's a good app though.,1
"too slow. app is slower than mobile site and/or competing livejournal apps  like""eljay"" (search the marketplace for it). what with the lack of features even in the main pc site  it's proof that livejournal is no match for even the much maligned facebook...rip livejournal.",-1
very good but can you add download all attachment as zip option ?  we miss this very nice feature which is available in web version.,1
"widget locks up my galaxy s3 this a very beautiful looking app and i like it a lot but it regularly locks up the homescreen widget  the clock freezes and the weather status locks up with the status ""locating"". my phone is a samsung galaxy s3 running on 4.1.1 based in the uk. hope this info helps solve the issue as this app is definitely worth a full 5 stars if it were not for it locking up. please fix this and i'll even purchase the add free pro version ;-)",-1

time time freezes and will not update since latest version.,-1
far from as cool as smartglass i went with a ps4 rather than the xbox one  but i do miss smart glass. they need to make this app enable the voice features  and things like the store should be built-in  not a browser link.,-1
finally  one great game for android.,1
excellent app no complaints at all but still waiting for urdu localization,1
good app great launcher.  i really like it but it is killing my battery.,0
regret buying this app fcs so randomly that it's almost impossible to use it for longer period of time.  lack of updates have made it even more impossible to use.  haven't seen even a single much requested feature by the community being implemented in this app despite being ok play store for more or less 4 months now.  disappointed.,-1
offline browsing please allow us to open local html or swf files.  there are few browsers out there that can not play local html but those lack the browsing/playing features of this app.,0
amazing this is freaking great,1
? not for motorola defy,0
thankyou waited for such an app for a long time. jazakallah!,1
awesome but... its a really good player no doubt. but since last update some of my albums wont show  and even songs wont show. not to mention it repeats some albums  and its not my memory card cause i only have 1 album for each group of songs. please fix this. its the best player ive come across id hate to have to uninstall it :(,0
cutiest emoticons cute emoticons to have fun..,1
game freezes! i play on the pc and now tried to play over and over on my samsung s3 and it freezes up after 2 min. in the game!,-1
great app! i love this app! it's great to have my book lists with me wherever i go and i can easily keep track of which books i've read to each of my kids. one thing missing is the browse feature like the apple version has; i miss that! add that and i will rate 5 stars!,1
? i love it  but some times it freezes and i have to do somthing else,-1
a superb app i came to android about a year ago from an iphone  and i tried every reddit client out there such as baconreader and reddit news. these were all good apps  but none of them compared to my experience with alienblue. then  i tried reddit sync and it has become almost exclusively the only way i read redditch anymore. the holo interface and black night mode are easy on my eyes and it has all of the features i need.,1
improving rapidly. this app used to be crappy while the service was ok  but recently the app has started receiving updates on a regular basis adding a lot of basic functionality that should have been there from the beginning. now it features landscape support  resume from last position  notification bar controls and save to sd card. however  i still sorely miss a decent widget  easily sortable queues or the extensions found in the desktop app.,1
